# There needs to be exactly 2 command line arguments unless the program wouldn't execute
# The first arg has to be the input file and the second has to be the output for the program to run properly
# the files need to be in the same folder as the theMain.java class
# if the input file doesn't exist the program will terminate immediately
#
# To run the program in command line:
# navigate to the folder directory using command-line 
# next type "javac theMain.java" then press enter
# afterwards type "java theMain <inputfileName> <outputfileName>" then press enter
# an example of the above line would be "java theMain input.txt output.txt"
